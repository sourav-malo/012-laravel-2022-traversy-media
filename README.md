This is my [second project](https://github.com/sourav-malo/012-laravel-2022-traversy-media) in my laravel mastery journey. I am always impressed with how [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYyJ4PuL4pY&t=11481s) organizes his course. Verily, I have got a good initial foundation of laravel. Up next, I am just going to finish the multi vendor ecommerce course of the [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/laravel-multi-vendor-ecommerce-project/).
